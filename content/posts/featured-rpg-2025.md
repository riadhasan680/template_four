Steam is currently down for millions of users worldwide. The store pages are failing to load, and the community market is inaccessible.

This outage comes right in the middle of the Winter Sale, causing frustration among gamers looking to grab deals. Valve has yet to issue an official statement, but reports are spiking on Downdetector.

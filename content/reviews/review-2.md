Hell is Us is shaping up to be one of the most intriguing titles of the year. Set in a country ravaged by civil war, players must navigate a landscape filled with both human and supernatural threats.

The combat is weighty and deliberate, clearly inspired by the Souls genre, but with its own unique twist involving a drone companion. The mystery at the heart of the story is compelling, urging players to explore every nook and cranny of the hauntingly beautiful world.

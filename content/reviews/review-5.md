You are a demon made of glass and pain. Your goal? Skate to the moon and swallow it. Skate Story is as weird as it sounds, and that's what makes it so brilliant.

The controls are tight and responsive, essential for a game that demands precision. The soundtrack is a vibe, perfectly complementing the dreamlike visuals. It's a game that oozes style and confidence.

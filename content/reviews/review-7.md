Metroid Prime 4: Beyond captures the isolation and atmosphere of the original trilogy while introducing modern controls and a larger world to explore. The scan visor has never felt more essential.

The boss battles are cinematic and challenging, pushing the Switch 2 hardware to its limits. It's a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling and level design.

summary: "Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma tries to innovate on the classic formula but stumbles in its execution. While the world is charming, the mechanics feel dated."

Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma attempts to revitalize the long-running series with a new setting and mechanics. However, for every step forward it takes with its visual presentation, it seems to take two steps back in terms of gameplay depth and character interaction.

The new combat system is flashy but lacks the strategic nuance of its predecessors. Farming, a core pillar of the series, feels oversimplified. Fans of the series might find enjoyment in the new characters, but the overall experience leaves much to be desired.

Two Point Museum has always been charming, but the Treasure DLC adds a layer of adventure that was missing. Sending expeditions to retrieve artifacts is a fun minigame that breaks up the management loop.

The new decorations and artifacts are hilarious, fitting perfectly with the game's tongue-in-cheek humor. It's a must-have for fans of the base game.

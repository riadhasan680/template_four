summary: "The Revenant episode brings some much-needed quality of life changes, but the core issues of the game remain."

Destiny 2: Revenant introduces a spooky theme and some fun new weapons. The vampire hunting aesthetic is cool, and the new dungeon is one of the best in years.

However, the new player experience is still a mess, and the grind is as real as ever. It's a step in the right direction, but Bungie has a long way to go to win back the community's trust.

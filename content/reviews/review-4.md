Exodus is not just another sci-fi shooter. It's a deep, narrative-driven RPG that explores the consequences of time dilation on a galactic scale. Your choices matter, not just for the immediate outcome, but for generations to come.

The visuals are stunning, capturing the vastness and mystery of space. The characters are well-written and memorable, making you care about their fates in this harsh universe.
